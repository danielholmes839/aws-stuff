# Winter Break 2021

Technologies I tried out during the Winter 2021 break.


## api-gateway + lambda

I setup a serverless API on AWS with Python and Go. It was very easy to setup and will probably save me money if I use AWS in the future.

## Kotlin

I implemented Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Kotlin to try the language. I wanted to try Kotlin to see if I would enjoy it more than Java. I watched ["How to Kotlin"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P20npkvcb8&ab_channel=AndroidDevelopers) and read a few tutorials.

## Ruby on Rails

I followed a tutorial for implementing CRUD operations for a single model. I don't think Rails is my kind of framework. Similar to how I don't like using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) in Python. I might try [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/documentation.html) though because Ruby is interesting.
